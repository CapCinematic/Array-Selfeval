// Above I used array methods to alter varibles. 
// The methods I used are Push, Shift and Pop.
// Push will take a new element and add it to the end of an array.
// Shift will remove the first element which in this cas would be position 0 valued at 3.
// Pop will remove the last element of an array which will be the extra boolean "false".
// I can see Push being very helpful for a growing list of names like a roster or reservation list.
