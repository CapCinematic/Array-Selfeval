# *Self Eval!*

- # How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I would say with consistent practice I feel around a 3 out of 5, in my mind I need a couple full days off to expierment and read up on all I've learned so far.
- # Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
At this point I would like to keep at this pace even if it is a little hard to do so, I would like to push through with the best of my abillities and when I have a little time off do some additional learning.
- # What questions do you have about Arrays?
No real questions besides what are some other really useful method, but that will be apart of the process and side research.
